# GieaBot
# Hello, we are the Hygiea team!
Of course, this cannot be done individually for the Final Projects because each duty requires a difficult process. As a result, this final project is completed in groups of 4-5 persons, and each group team has a name. We belong to a group named "Hygiea," which comprises of 5 members, each of whom has a jobdesk. According to our partner Power Academy X Orbit Future Academy, the name "Hygiea" was drawn from one of the names of an asteroid that is located in the main asteroid belt. This name was inspired by the partners we worked with during MSIB. The Hygiea team's profile and responsibilities are as follows:
